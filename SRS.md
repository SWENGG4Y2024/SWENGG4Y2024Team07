# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Online Learning Management System (LMS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the Online Learning Management System (LMS). It outlines the system's functional and non-functional requirements, guiding the development team in creating a web-based platform that meets the needs of students, instructors, and administrators.

### 1.2 Scope
The LMS is designed to manage online courses, enabling students to enroll in courses, access materials, participate in quizzes and assignments, and track their progress. Instructors will be able to create and manage courses, upload materials, grade assignments, and monitor student progress. Administrators will manage user accounts, monitor system usage, and resolve technical issues.
